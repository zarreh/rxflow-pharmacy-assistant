#### 5. **Drug Interaction System** (`DRUG_INTERACTIONS`)
- ✅ **Clinically Accurate Interactions** with severity levels
- ✅ **Management Recommendations** for each interaction
- ✅ **Contraindicated Combinations** clearly identified
- ✅ **Patient Education Information** included

**Interaction Examples:**
- Lisinopril + Ibuprofen: Moderate severity, BP/kidney monitoring needed
- Eliquis + Warfarin: Contraindicated, severe bleeding risk
- Atorvastatin + Grapefruit: Moderate severity, muscle toxicity risk

#### 6. **GoodRx-Style Discount System** (`GOODRX_DISCOUNTS`)
- ✅ **Multiple Discount Programs** with realistic savings rates
- ✅ **Manufacturer Coupons** for specialty medications
- ✅ **Eligibility Criteria** and program limitations

#### 7. **Order Tracking System** (`ORDER_TRACKING`)
- ✅ **Order Status Workflow** from received to pickup
- ✅ **Processing Time Estimates** by prescription type

### Technical Implementation Highlights:

#### **Data Structure Quality**
- **Healthcare Realistic**: Uses actual RxCUI codes and medical terminology
