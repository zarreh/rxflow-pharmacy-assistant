Monitor blood pressure and kidney function, and consider acetaminophen for pain relief.\n\t+ Moderate: Lithium may have increased levels due to lisinopril, leading to toxicity. Monitor lithium levels and watch for signs of lithium toxicity.\n\t+ Major: Potassium supplements may cause dangerously high potassium levels (hyperkalemia). Monitor potassium levels closely and consider alternative supplements if necessary.\n* **Allergies:** The patient does not have any known allergies.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Monitor blood pressure and kidney function regularly to ensure the medication is effective and safe.\n* Consider using acetaminophen for pain relief instead of ibuprofen, as it may reduce the risk of kidney problems.\n* Monitor lithium levels closely if the patient is taking lithium and lisinopril simultaneously.\n\nI recommend that you proceed with the refill process, keeping these safety considerations in mind.
